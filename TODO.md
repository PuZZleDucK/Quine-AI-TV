# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `neonlaundromat` (src/channels/neonlaundromat.js): visual bug — event text overflows from container - previous attempt to fix failed
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `neonlaundromat` (src/channels/neonlaundromat.js): determinism — switch `update(dt)` to a fixed-timestep sim loop (`SIM_DT=1/60` accumulator) so 30fps/60fps screenshot captures match for the same seed (special-moment schedules + drum rotation cadence-stable).
