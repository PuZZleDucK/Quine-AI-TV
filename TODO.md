## Follow-ups queued from review: icecorelab

- [ ] `icecorelab` UI (src/channels/icecorelab.js): add a depth/age readout tied to scan position (panel + core marker).
<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (icecorelab micro-striation) -->
- [ ] `icecorelab` visuals (src/channels/icecorelab.js): add a small “sample tray / chip” extracted during CUT→ANALYZE so the action reads (keep OSD clear).
- [ ] `icecorelab` UI/visuals (src/channels/icecorelab.js): tie isotope chart to ash bands (e.g. a deterministic spike or band marker aligned to volcanic layer depth).
