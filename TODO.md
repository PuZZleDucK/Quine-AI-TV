## Follow-ups queued from review: packetsfm

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `packetsfm` (src/channels/packetsnifferfm.js): determinism — remove per-frame `rand()` usage from `updateWaterfall()` and packet spawning; schedule bursts in absolute time / fixed timestep so 30fps vs 60fps captures match.
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `packetsfm` (src/channels/packetsnifferfm.js): perf — cache background+vignette gradients and panel gradients (waterfall sheen, dial header, knob radial) on init/resize/ctx swap. Accept: steady-state `render()` creates 0 gradients/frame.
<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (packetsfm spectrum hsla allocs) -->
<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (audio hygiene) -->
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `packetsfm` (src/channels/packetsnifferfm.js): text/dialog — add a seeded rotating “packet log” / callout strip (5+ minutes before repeating), clipped OSD-safe.
