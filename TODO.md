if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick a least reviewed channel and perform a detailed review (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] Review channel `synthwave` (src/channels/synthwave.js): capture screenshots (0–300s), do code+audio review, add `// REVIEWED: 2026-02-15`, and queue concrete follow-ups.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `synthwave` (src/channels/synthwave.js): long-run interest — add a rare deterministic “POLICE LIGHTS” special moment (~2–5 min) with unmistakable color sweep on grid + car + skyline, OSD-safe EVENT label, and clean reset.

# pending - do not do

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — postcard looks meh and text is not postcard like - redesign and add better parody postcard text and layout

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — flip the postcard for the last 15 seconds showing parody postcard image for location on the other side
