# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard layout — ensure the postcard bullet section never truncates mid-word (add ellipsis on the last line when wrapping exceeds the max lines).

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): long-run interest — add 6–10 more real-world destinations (with palette + vibe/food/fact + HUMOR_BY_CITY line) so repeats are rarer.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): special moments — add 1–2 rare deterministic desk moments (~2–5 min) (e.g. “PASSPORT STAMP”, “ROUTE UPDATE”) that clearly change the map/route styling briefly and then reset.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): street feed variety — add occasional foreground pass (streetlight pole / bus silhouette / neon sign) with parallax so the inset feels less static over minutes.
