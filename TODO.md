  - Pick an **unreviewed** channel and perform a **detailed review** (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

- [ ] `news` (src/channels/news.js): special moments — add 1–2 rare deterministic events (~45–120s) with a clear “broadcast” signature (e.g. BREAKING banner + flash, FIELD REPORT lower-third sweep), clean reset, and OSD-safe placement.
- [ ] `news` (src/channels/news.js): audio hygiene — make `onAudioOn()` idempotent and ensure `onAudioOff()`/`destroy()` clear AudioManager.current only when owned (match other channels).
