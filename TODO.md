if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick an **unreviewed** channel and perform a **detailed review** (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

## Follow-ups queued from review: lasercutfile

- [ ] `lasercutfile` (src/channels/lasercutfile.js): determinism — make sparks emission FPS-stable (drive from cut progress distance or fixed-timestep sim; avoid per-frame `rand()` in `update()` so 30fps/60fps captures match).
<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (lasercutfile sparks cap perf) -->
- [ ] `lasercutfile` (src/channels/lasercutfile.js): special moments — add 1–2 rare deterministic events (~1–3 min cadence): e.g. “MATERIAL CHANGE” palette swap / “AIR ASSIST BURST” smoke puff + brief HUD badge, clean reset.
<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (lasercutfile bed frame texture) -->
