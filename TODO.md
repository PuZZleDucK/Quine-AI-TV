- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `tugdispatch` (src/channels/harbortugdispatch.js): special moment — add 1–2 rare deterministic events (~45–120s) with unmistakable signature + clean reset (e.g. “FOG HORN” + visibility haze sweep, “PILOT BOARDING” stamp, “SECURITY SWEEP” beam). If audio.enabled, add a short non-stacking cue.
