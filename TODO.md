if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick an **unreviewed** channel and perform a **detailed review** (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

# TODO Queue

- [ ] `neonlaundromat` (src/channels/neonlaundromat.js): special moment — add a rare deterministic “POWER SURGE” event (~45–120s cadence; seeded) that briefly increases neon flicker, dims the room for ~2–5s.

- [ ] `neonlaundromat` (src/channels/neonlaundromat.js): text variety — expand the LOST SOCK alert content pool (more alert titles/items/secondary lines) and schedule via a seeded shuffle bag so it can run 5+ minutes without obvious repeats.
