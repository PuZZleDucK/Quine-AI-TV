# TODO Queue
- [project:quine-tv] Visual polish `dreamreceipt` (src/channels/dreamreceipt.js): paper is wider than the hole, the machine needs to be wider and more interesting.
- [project:quine-tv] Visual polish `dreamreceipt` (src/channels/dreamreceipt.js): pause once printed should be longer. then receipt should fall down off screen.
- [project:quine-tv] Visual polish `dreamreceipt` (src/channels/dreamreceipt.js): add subtle counter texture/film grain and stronger printer-slot lighting/shadow so the scene reads less “flat”. Accept: 0–60s capture shows visible texture + depth improve receipt legibility.
- [project:quine-tv] Visual polish `dreamreceipt` (src/channels/dreamreceipt.js): coupons should be printed as part of a receipt.
- [project:quine-tv] Content polish `dreamreceipt` (src/channels/dreamreceipt.js): expand receipt text variety (more headers/footers/notes) and add 1 rare special moment beyond glitch/coupon (e.g., VOID stamp / “TOTAL: ???” scramble) scheduled deterministically (~45–120s). Accept: 5min capture shows at least one additional special moment; deterministic per seed.
