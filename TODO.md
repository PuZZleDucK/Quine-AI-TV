- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `futurearch` (src/channels/futurearch.js): perf — cache pedestal gradients (spotlight cone + pedestal body) so steady-state `render()` allocates 0 gradients/frame (rebuild on resize/ctx swap).
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `futurearch` (src/channels/futurearch.js): perf — pre-wrap placard bullet text on artifact change / resize (avoid per-frame `split()` + `measureText()` in `wrapText()`).
