if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick a least reviewed channel and perform a detailed review (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `synthwave` (src/channels/synthwave.js): visuals — add an occasional deterministic foreground silhouette pass (road sign / billboard / bridge segment) to break up the large empty grid over minutes (keep OSD clear).

# pending - do not do

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — flip the postcard for the last 15 seconds showing parody postcard image for location on the other side
