# TODO Queue

## Follow-ups queued from review: forgeanvil

- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals - forge and fire needs to look better, move more to the side
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals — make workshop props more opaque and pushed further to the side
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visual storytelling — add an explicit quench tank/bucket and a dunk motion synced to QUENCH phase (steam should originate from the waterline).
