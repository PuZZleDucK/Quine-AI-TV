if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick an **unreviewed** channel and perform a **detailed review** (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

- [ ] [lava] Determinism: switch to fixed-timestep update (or deterministic scheduler) so 30fps vs 60fps yields identical captures for the same seed (similar approach to `flowfield`). File: src/channels/lava.js.
- [ ] [lava] Composition: add a lamp silhouette (glass outline + base/cap) and keep blobs within it (clip path or mask) so it reads as an actual lava *lamp*, not just blobs-on-black. File: src/channels/lava.js.
