<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (mailroomtube PRIORITY EXPRESS) -->

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `mailroomtube` (src/channels/mailroomtube.js): visuals — replace tube direction tick dots with small chevrons oriented along edge direction (edit in `drawTubes()` direction ticks loop); cache tick positions/angles per edge in `rebuildGeometry()`.

<!-- done: moved to TODONE.md (mailroomtube dispatch log expand + overrides) -->

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `mailroomtube` (src/channels/mailroomtube.js): special moment — add a second rare deterministic event “BULK DROP” (~90–210s) that temporarily increases spawn cadence + thickens tube glow for ~6–10s, with an OSD-safe HUD banner; clean reset; use separate RNG like `expressPlan`.
