# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `foleylab` (src/channels/foleylab.js): long-run variety — switch `nextRecipe()` to a seeded shuffle-bag so recipes don’t repeat back-to-back; add 4–6 more recipes so it stays fresh for 5+ minutes.
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `foleylab` (src/channels/foleylab.js): UI/visual polish — add a small “VU meter / waveform” panel tied to step density (OSD-safe) + 1–2 rare deterministic special moments (e.g., TAKE GOOD stamp / mic clip overload flash) scheduled ~45–120s.
