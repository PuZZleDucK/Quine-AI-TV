- [ ] `kitchen` (src/channels/kitchenscience.js): long-run interest — expand `EXPERIMENTS` + use a seeded shuffle-bag (no immediate repeats; 5+ minutes before repeating).
- [ ] `kitchen` (src/channels/kitchenscience.js): special moment — add 1–2 rare deterministic “SCIENCE FAIR” events (~45–120s cadence) with a clear visual signature and clean reset.
