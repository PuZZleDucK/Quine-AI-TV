# TODO Queue

# ready

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `oceanpostcards` (src/channels/archive/oceanpostcards.js): composition — increase creature prominence inside the postcard window (bigger + clearer silhouette/highlight) so it reads at a glance (esp. in screenshots).

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `oceanpostcards` (src/channels/archive/oceanpostcards.js): special moment — add a rare deterministic “SUBMERSIBLE LIGHT SWEEP” (or bioluminescent bloom) across the window (~2–5 min cadence), with a clear signature look and clean reset (OSD-safe).

# pending - do not do

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — flip the postcard for the last 15 seconds showing parody postcard image for location on the other side
