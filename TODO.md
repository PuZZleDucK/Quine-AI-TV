# TODO Queue

- [quine-tv] `elevatorpanel` (src/channels/elevatorpanel.js): Visual - show a diagram of the building on the right with the elevator shafts and elevators highlighted
- [quine-tv] `elevatorpanel` (src/channels/elevatorpanel.js): Visual - call queue should be populated at random and serviced by elevators
- [quine-tv] `elevatorpanel` (src/channels/elevatorpanel.js): Buttons — replace simple chase light with persistent “selected floor” LEDs tied to CALL/QUEUE, plus press animation when a call is queued.
- [quine-tv] `elevatorpanel` (src/channels/elevatorpanel.js): Long-run interest — add 1–2 rare deterministic “special moments” (~45–120s) (e.g., fire-service key mode, overload alarm, inspection glitch) with clear visual signature and clean reset.

- [quine-tv] `stitchalong` (src/channels/constellationstitch.js): Long-run interest — expand pattern variety (more constellations/edge sets) and add a rare deterministic “special moment” (~45–120s) (e.g., shooting-star sweep that briefly re-threads a segment, or rare constelations) with clean reset and OSD-safe flash.
