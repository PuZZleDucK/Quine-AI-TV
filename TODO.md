# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `orbits` (src/channels/orbits.js): visual - more interesting planets

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `orbits` (src/channels/orbits.js): visual - cycle through different orbit layouts every 5 minutes

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `orbits` (src/channels/orbits.js): special moment — add a rare deterministic “COMET PASS” (shooting star + trail) scheduled ~3-5 minutes.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `orbits` (src/channels/orbits.js): time structure — add a deterministic 2–4 min phase cycle (CALM→WARP→DRIFT) modulating orbit speeds + palette/nebula intensity with smooth easing.
