if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick an **unreviewed** channel and perform a **detailed review** (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

# TODO Queue

- [ ] duckdebug (src/channels/rubberduck.js): Add explicit time-structured phases (e.g. calm → crisis → resolution) that modulate typing speed, scanline intensity, and hold durations.
- [ ] duckdebug (src/channels/rubberduck.js): Add 1–2 rare “special moments” on timers (e.g. brief CRT glitch/flicker + BUG/FIX stamp overlay) without hurting OSD legibility.
- [ ] duckdebug (src/channels/rubberduck.js): Expand dialog pools (BUG_NOUNS/VERBS/OBJECTS, OPENERS, LESSONS) and add a short fake stack-trace snippet generator so it can run 5+ minutes without obvious repeats.
- [ ] duckdebug (src/channels/rubberduck.js): Cache char width + maxChars on init/resize to avoid measureText() every frame.
