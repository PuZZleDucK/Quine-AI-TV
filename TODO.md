# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `aquarium` (src/channels/aquarium.js): caustics — replace the straight-line caustics bands with a cached moving caustics texture (offscreen tile) so the surface light reads organic, not like scanlines.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `aquarium` (src/channels/aquarium.js): depth — add a subtle midground layer (faint silhouettes/rocks or fog band) and push fish into 2 depth planes (slight blur/alpha/scale) to reduce the “everything is on one flat plane” feeling.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `aquarium` (src/channels/aquarium.js): special moments — add 1 more rare deterministic event with an unmistakable signature (e.g. “FEEDING TIME” sparkle drift / flashlight cone sweep) scheduled on the existing `randEvents` cadence and kept behind fish.

# pending - do not do

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — flip the postcard for the last 15 seconds showing parody postcard image for location on the other side
