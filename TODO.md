if `TODO.md` has no ready items:
  - Pick a least reviewed channel and perform a detailed review (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

# TODO Queue


- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): street feed — street feed should look slightly different for each location. 

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): street feed variety — add occasional foreground pass (streetlight pole / bus silhouette / neon sign / moon) with parallax so the inset feels less static over minutes.

# pending - do not do

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — postcard looks meh and text is not postcard like - redesign and add better parody postcard text and layout

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `traveldesk` (src/channels/traveldesk.js): postcard — flip the postcard for the last 15 seconds showing parody postcard image for location on the other side
