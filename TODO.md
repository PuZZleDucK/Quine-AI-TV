## Follow-ups queued from review: forgeanvil

- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals - make anvil look better
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals - improve hammer and make it swing in an arc
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals - forge and fire needs to look better, move more to the side
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals — made workshop props more opaque and pushed further to the side
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visuals - rotate though several glowing hot items being worked on on anvil
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): visual storytelling — add an explicit quench tank/bucket and a dunk motion synced to QUENCH phase (steam should originate from the waterline).
- [ ] `forgeanvil` (src/channels/forgeanvil.js): audio polish — avoid “beep-y” clicks on strikes; shape hits with envelopes + add a short hiss/steam noise burst on quench (respect audio.enabled; no stacking).
