- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `duckdebug` (src/channels/rubberduck.js): content — expand `fakeStackTrace()` with 4–6 more templates + a couple of “diff snippet” style lines; verify `wrapForTerminal()` keeps indentation and never overflows.

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] `duckdebug` (src/channels/rubberduck.js): special moments — add a second rare deterministic event (e.g. “CORE DUMP” mini-scroll or “PANIC” overlay) scheduled independently of the current stamp/glitch and with a clean reset.
