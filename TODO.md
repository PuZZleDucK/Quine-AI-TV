  - Pick an **unreviewed** channel and perform a **detailed review** (per `/home/puzzleduck/x/quine-tv/AGENTS.md`).

# TODO Queue

- [ ] [project:quine-tv] Review follow-up `dominofactory` (src/channels/dominofactory.js): visual identity — add a cached midground “factory clutter” layer (bolts/rivets/hazard decals/soft grime) that stays OSD-safe and rebuilds on resize.
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] Review follow-up `dominofactory` (src/channels/dominofactory.js): long-run interest — add 1–2 rare deterministic special moments (e.g. overhead light sweep / QC stamp / forklift silhouette pass) scheduled ~45–120s with a clear, signature look + clean reset.
- [ ] [project:quine-tv] Review follow-up `dominofactory` (src/channels/dominofactory.js): text/dialog — add a seeded rotating “line log” under the HUD (funny factory status codes; lasts 5+ minutes; clipped so it never overlaps OSD).
